* Synopsis

While [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] are a great combination with a great ecosystem that can be extended in so many ways, there are times when it needs to interact with other systems.

The goal of [[https://github.com/heyste/org2json][org2json]] is to build on top of the work done by [[https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize/blob/master/README.md][orgize]], a parsing library (with various [[https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize/tree/master/examples][examples]]), and provide an executable for generating json from any org file.

* Using [[https://www.docker.com][Docker]]

** Convert .org to .json

The following command will map the current folder inside the docker container, process =README.org= and then save the json output as the file =README.json=. Also, it's going to delete the container when finished.

#+begin_src bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/docs heyste/org2json /app/org2json /docs/README.org > README.json
#+end_src

** Using jq

With other tools like [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] it's possible to explore the json structure of a document.

#+begin_src bash :eval never-export :exports both
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/docs heyste/org2json /app/org2json /docs/README.org | jq .children[0]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src bash
